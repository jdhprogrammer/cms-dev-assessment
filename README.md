### Description

```
The Assessment Challenge was to recreate an HTML layout using css 
grid responsive layout design, dynamically created and populated 
html using javascript, using data retrieved from an API. Their were 
4 parts. I decided to take this assement in a slightly different 
direction. I made a React Application that accomplised the same 
effect. I used Hooks such as useState and useEffect. I used JSX 
components for my Container, Rows, Cols, Buttons, and more. 
I imported images and randomized their selection to each dynamically 
created column of data. I gave each listening, event and offer a 
unique id to track them by. I learned how to deploy to firebase, 
and created a firebase app and hosting site for part 1 and part 2.
```

#### User Story

```
As a company looking to hire a new Frontend Developer, I want see 
that you know your way around the basics, and get an idea of how 
advanced your knowledge of the programming languages is. I also 
want to see how quickly you solve a problem, and what you do once 
you have solved it.
```

#### More Details

```
I hope I can help Simpleview achieve their goals, gain new customers, 
and advance their share of the web application market.
